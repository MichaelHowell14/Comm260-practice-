            About me
        </h2>
        <p1>
            My name is Michael Howell, I am a Junior Business Education major at North Dakota State University. 
            I graduated from Dassel-Cokato High School in 2017. I spent 2 years at Winona State University, joined the Minnesota Army National Guard
            and then spent a year overseas before continuing my education at NDSU in the Fall of 2021. <br>
            Some of my interests are playing guitar, hunting, working out, and hanging out with my friends and family. During the summer I play baseball on my local 
            amatuer baseball team the <a href="https://www.dcsaints.com/"> Dassel-Cokato Saints.</a>
