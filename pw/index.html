        <p1>
            My name is Michael Howell, I am a Junior Business Education major at North Dakota State University. 
            I graduated from Dassel-Cokato High School in 2017. I spent 2 years at Winona State University, joined<br><img src="img/BradyWedding.jpg" alt="Celebrating a wedding with Ciara" width="250px;" style="float:right;"> the Minnesota Army National Guard
            and then spent a year overseas before continuing my education at NDSU in the Fall of 2021. <br>
            Some of my interests are playing guitar, hunting, working out, and hanging out with my friends and family. During the summer I play baseball on my local 
            amatuer baseball team the <a href="https://www.dcsaints.com/"> Dassel-Cokato Saints.</a>

            I am creating this website for my Comm 260 class at NDSU. I hope to teach you more about <br>
            my life and what I enjoy doing. You'll learn more in depth about my family, friends, hobbies, <br>
            and military career.
