        <p font face="arial" size= "20px" color="blue"> Something excited happened. I've started to learn how to code! While I'm not too great at it yet, I have started to get the basics down. I'm excited to learn how to use CSS to make my posts look better and hopefully by the time you're reading this I've got it down better.</p>   
        <h2> <a id="#Second Post">Second Post</a></h2>
        <h6>September 2021</h6>
        <p> I've gotten a bit better at coding since my first post. I'm now able to link my table of contents to the post you click on! Hopefully this should make navigating my blog a bit easier. </p>
