        <h2>All About Me</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            My name is Michael Howell, I am a Junior Business Education major at North Dakota State University. 
            I graduated from Dassel-Cokato High School in 2017. I spent 2 years at Winona State University, joined the Minnesota Army National Guard
            and then spent a year overseas before continuing my education at NDSU in the Fall of 2021.
            Some of my interests are playing guitar, hunting, working out, and hanging out with my friends and family. During the summer I play baseball on my local 
            amatuer baseball team the <a href="https://www.dcsaints.com/"> Dassel-Cokato Saints.</a> 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Army Career</h2>
        <p>I joined the Minnesota Army National Guard in September 2018. After completing basic training 
            down in Fort Benning, Georgia I was assigned to Charlie Company 2-135 Infantry Battallion as a rifleman.
            Serving in the Army has been one of my proudest accomplishments, ever since I was a little kid I wanted to
            serve. I grew up idolizing my Grandpa who served in the Korean War, I'm pretty sure he's more proud of me for 
            my service than I am of it. Serving with Charlie Company has been better than I could have ever asked for, I've 
            made some great friends, had the best mentors possible, and gotten to take advantage of some pretty cool 
            oppurtunities. I served overseas in Africa for a year where we got to spend time training with both the locals,
            the french, and across differnt United Staes branches. I can't wait to see where the Army takes me next.  </p>
       <h2>Friends</h2>
       <p>Throughout my life I've been blessed to make friends everywhere I go. My lifelong best friend is John Busche, 
           we grew up together in Dassel-Cokato and I can safely say he will be my best man someday when I get married.
           On the spectrum of my friends John is defintley the one that encourages good decisions. My friends Jake and Dylan
           however, do not. I met both Jake and Dylan Freshman year of college and for our time at Winona State we were inseperable,
           whether is was going out to the bars (sorry mom), skipping classes together (Again, sorry mom) or hitting the gym late 
           at night, we were always toegether. My girlfriend is Ciara Heaton, we met in the most covid-19 possible way, through
           Tinder. We've been dating now for a little over 6 months and I'm very excited to see what's in our future together.

       <h2>Music</h2>
       </a>
       <p>Music has always been one of my absolute favorite things in the world. Growing up I have fond memories of
           riding in the car with my dad while an old episode of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 was playing on the radio.
           Growing up in my house we listened to a lot of "The Beatles" or "The Rolling Stones". During high school I started to branch
           out and start listening to more grass roots country music. Nowadays you'll mostly find me listening to Zach Bryan, Turnpike
           Troubadours, Koe Wetzel, Shane Smith and the Saints, or Charles Wesley Godwin. My brother David learned how to play guitar
           in High School and while I was overseas he encouraged me to learn how to play to help pass the time. Now whenever I have free 
           time I can be found picking on my guitar trying to figure out whatever riff is stuck in my head.
